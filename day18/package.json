  "description": "A server that takes in username, email and password from a SIGNUP route to create a user, and has a LOGIN route to authenticate the user using the password and the email or username. The signup route saves the time and date the user signed up and the server have that data ready on a protected \"getuser\" route. The \"getuser\" route will take in the user’s email. On a user’s authenticated login through the \"login\" route, the server returns a session token (tokenized with the email) as the response to make sure only an authenticated user with that token can access the \"getuser\" route; this token will be sent with the \"getuser\" request in the request header as the value of the \"Authorization\" key; it will have a \"Bearer\" prefix. The token will be verified on each \"getuser\" request to be sure the session token is valid and has not expired. This server uses a local MongoDB instance and the generatedObjectID is returned in the getuser route",
